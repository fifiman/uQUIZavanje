### Learning Django

* [Official Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/tutorial01/), will probably be enough.

## Installation 

What is needed to run webserver:

1. Python 3 (>= 3.6)
2. Pip
3. Django

Python and pip installation instructions can be found online. Once you have python and pip, django can be installed using `pip install Django`. Check whether django is properly installed using `python -m django --version`.

## Running

`python manage.py runserver`

## Source control

Everyone should have their own branch and only merge into the `master` branch with a pull request.
